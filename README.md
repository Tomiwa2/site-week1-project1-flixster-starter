### Reflection

- Did the topics discussed in your labs prepare you to complete the assignment? Be specific, which features in your weekly assignment did you feel unprepared to complete?

      Honestly, I feel like they would have, they only problem was the lack of time! Given enough time, I highly believe they would have prepared me for the assignment
        
         The features i found unprepared to complete include;
             Javascript related features
            Some CSS Animations 


- If you had more time, what would you have done differently? Would you have added additional features? Changed the way your project responded to a particular event, etc.
   For sureee! 
   I would have changed to background colour and all the buttons(clear more...) to look more appealing!
   I would have made the website more responsive, like made the flixter title go back the home page
   I would have added the popup, trailer videos and made an attempt to add the video link itself. 
     I would all in all have made the website more functional!

- Reflect on your project demo, what went well? Were there things that maybe didn't go as planned? Did you notice something that your peer did that you would like to try next time?

      I think the opening the floor in the first week for volunteers went well! 
      I liked the way my peers showed their code and listened to the feedback! and i would like them to continue next time!

### Open-source libraries used

- Add any links to open-source libraries used in your project.
Our instructors of course!(they ARE open-source libraries if you think about it)
W3 schools
MDN Docs
the codepath pages on more info

### Shout out

Give a shout out to somebody from your cohort that especially helped you during your project. This can be a fellow peer, instructor, TA, mentor, etc.
 Shout out to all my instructors: Ashaane(I know i spelt it wrong sorrryy), Sammy and Paige as they try so hard their best to make sure we have all we need to matriculate from this program as well as trying to make us well rounded for the industry! And that in my opinion is hard but they never stop trying.

 Shout out to all my scholors fpr making themselves so approachable, i know that because everyone of them had a hand in this project!(at least i think its everyone of them)
